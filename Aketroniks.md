Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19.
## Summary
Aketroniks has been providing services in embedded systems since 2013. Using this experience, we develop IoT devices with wifi,
bluetooth, ethernet capacity. We want to enter the blockchain field by using this capacity. The Helium project draws our attention
both with its field of interest and with the technology it has developed.

## Company Information (required)
In 2013, AKETRONİKS LTD was established as a company which makes research&development, design and production of electronic systems, 
mainly used in industrial kitchen equipments. AKETRONİKS LTD, which has cutting-edge and powerful machine park, has world-class factory 
for the production of embedded electronic systems. Besides, AKETRONİKS LTD has continued its activities as R&D Center, 
which is approved by Ministry of Industry and Technology, since March 2018. To date, we have produced 350k products of various types.
We want to concentrate our productions on the blockchain field. We think that the Helium project is the right project where we can use 
our experience.

## Product Information (required)
We are planning to use 64-bit A64 allwinner processor based board on product. The board is our custom design and amenable to changes. 
Besides this board has wifi, BT and ethernet capacity. We are using Linux OS for development and we are developing our custom kernel.
We have our custom server for updating and controlling. We able to provide CMS-1 (customer manager system) and CMS-2 (content manager system) so the customers can change their product settings online.

Hotspot: Bütün network ayarlarını yapabilen hotspot türü.
Lightspot: Sadece veri aktarımı yapabilen hotspot türü.
outdoor olabilmesi için suya, sıcağa dayanıklılık vs istiyorlar.

* Is this is Light Hotspot or Full Hotspot? (please submit two separate applications for Full and Light hotspots)
* Is it for indoor or outdoor?
* Provide a brief description of what you're making.

## What is your approximate price point? (required)
piyasa 500 dolar ile 1000 dolar arasında değişiyor.

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts (required)
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. 
This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 

## What is your expected production and delivery timeline? (required)

## Previous shipments (required)

## Startups welcome! 
* Have you shipped anything in the past? Yes or No
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? 
* Which countries do you plan to ship to? 

## Customer Support (required)
* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products? 
* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 


## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? 
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?

## Hardware Information (required)
* Please let us know:

* Which security (swarm) element are you using? 
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) 
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs 
* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
* Have you built gateways before? 
* How many gateways did you make? 
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
