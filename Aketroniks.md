Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19.
## Summary
Aketroniks has been providing services in embedded systems since 2013. Using this experience, we develop IoT devices with wifi,
bluetooth, ethernet capacity. We want to enter the blockchain field by using this capacity. The Helium project draws our attention
both with its field of interest and with the technology it has developed.

## Company Information
In 2013, AKETRONİKS LTD was established as a company which makes research&development, design and production of electronic systems, 
mainly used in industrial kitchen equipments. AKETRONİKS LTD, which has cutting-edge and powerful machine park, has world-class factory

which is approved by Ministry of Industry and Technology, since March 2018. To date, we have produced 350k products of various types.
We want to concentrate our productions on the blockchain field. We think that the Helium project is the right project where we can use 
our experience.

## Product Information
We are planning to use 64-bit A64 allwinner processor based board on product. The board is our custom design and amenable to changes. 
Besides this board has wifi, BT and ethernet capacity. We are using Linux OS for development and we are developing our custom kernel.
We have our custom server for updating and controlling. We able to provide CMS-1 (customer manager system) and CMS-2 (content manager system) so the customers can change their product settings online.

* Is this is Light Hotspot or Full Hotspot? \
We are planning to produce Full Hotspot.
* Is it for indoor or outdoor? \
Both, we are going to offer two choices one for outdoor one for indoor.
* Provide a brief description of what you're making. \
We are going to produce 64-bit full hotspot. The board will have 1 GB ram and linux OS. We are planning to combine the customizable board with LORA SX1302. For the security option we are going to use ECC608 crypto chip and linux crypto options. 

## price point
  indoor, Ethernet/Wifi — $450\
  Outdoor, Ethernet/Wifi — $750  

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts (required)
We have similiar iot products so we have experience about registration, customer service, security and weather resistant products. We want to work with your 
project and desired product professionally so we are open to contact for talk about products and requests. We are still working on the project. However, we do not see any harm in presenting some of the studies. \

## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? \
Yes, we will use linux encryption techniques. For update packages and firmware.
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No? \
Yes, we are going to use ECC608 crypto chip.
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?

## Hardware Information (required)
<img src="https://akecloud.com/Ake_lora_rak.jpg" width="300">
* Please let us know:

* Which security (swarm) element are you using? \
We are going to use ECC608 crypto chip. For security we open any offer and suggestions. Any changes can be made at any time. We develop all our products in every field. These areas are electronics, web software, phone applications or embedded systems. In other words, we are open to developing together by communicating.
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) 
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs \
We are planing to use SX1302  
* Where are you sourcing your components from? \
We have many suppliers in China and we can purchase from European and Asian countries. We have not had any problems with supply so far.
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
* Have you built gateways before? 
* How many gateways did you make? 
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 

## Risks & Challenges (required)
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
